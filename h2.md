## Warm-up exercise

### Intrusion Kill Chain

- Part of a famous paper in the cyber security field
- Applied from the U.S. Armed Forces kill chain
  - It's made to understand better how cyber attacks work to people, who aren't specialized in computers
- The Intrusion Kill Chain is a seven-part process:
  - Reconnaissance
  - Weaponization
  - Delivery
  - Exploitation
  - Installation
  - Command and Control
  - Actions on Objectives

## Setuping Linux with Vagrant

<details>
  <summary>Installing VirtualBox and Vagrant</summary>
<br>
  
I used these following commands to install the required software on my system:

```
sudo dnf install -y dnf-plugins-core
sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://rpm.releases.hashicorp.com/fedora/hashicorp.repo
sudo dnf -y install vagrant
sudo dnf -y install VirtualBox
```

Because I already installed the software, I can show you that what should happen if you try to run these commands again.

  <summary>Setuping a Virtual Machine environment</summary>
<br>
My starting point is from my home directory. Because a Virtual machine needs its own file, I made a folder called "debian-h2". Then I moved to the folder.

```
mkdir vms/debian-h2
cd vms/debian-h2
```

I proceeded to initialize a new Vagrant environment by creating a Vagrantfile. Then I simply started the virtual machine.

```
vagrant init debian/bookworm64
vagrant up
```

Then I checked if I could connect to the virtual machine I just made. Because I didn't configure a custom name to it, I connected to the virtual machine simply like this:

```
vagrant ssh
```
