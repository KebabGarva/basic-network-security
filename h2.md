This exercise is done using the following equipment:

- [*Physical hardware: Lenovo Legion 7 16ACHg6*](https://nanoreview.net/en/laptop/lenovo-legion-7-2021-amd?m=c.1_g.3_r.3_s.3)
- [*Operating system: Fedora Workstation 40*](https://fedoraproject.org/workstation/download)
- [*Vagrant*](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/tutorials/getting-started)
- [*Virtual machine: Debian 12 Bookworm*](https://app.vagrantup.com/debian/boxes/bookworm64)

### When?

The whole report was done on 28th August 2024.


## Warm-up exercise

### Intrusion Kill Chain

- Part of a famous paper in the cyber security field
- Applied from the U.S. Armed Forces kill chain
  - It's made to understand better how cyber attacks work to people, who aren't specialized in computers
- The Intrusion Kill Chain is a seven-part process:
  - Reconnaissance
  - Weaponization
  - Delivery
  - Exploitation
  - Installation
  - Command and Control
  - Actions on Objectives

## Messing around with Vagrant and the virtual machine I made

<details>
  <summary>Installing VirtualBox and Vagrant</summary>
<br>
  
I used these following commands to install the required software on my system:

```
sudo dnf install -y dnf-plugins-core
sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://rpm.releases.hashicorp.com/fedora/hashicorp.repo
sudo dnf -y install vagrant
sudo dnf -y install VirtualBox
```

Because I already installed the software, I can show you that what should happen if you try to run these commands again.

  <summary>Setuping a Virtual Machine environment</summary>
<br>
My starting point is from my home directory. Because a Virtual machine needs its own file, I made a folder called "debian-h2". Then I moved to the folder.

```
mkdir vms/debian-h2
cd vms/debian-h2
```

I proceeded to initialize a new Vagrant environment by creating a Vagrantfile. Then I simply started the virtual machine.

```
vagrant init debian/bookworm64
vagrant up
```

Then I checked if I could connect to the virtual machine I just made. Because I didn't configure a custom name to it, I connected to the virtual machine simply like this:

```
vagrant ssh
```

<summary>Upgrading all the software in Bookworm and installing Apache2</summary>

<br>
  
Upgrading the software is simple on Debian. You have to update first the repositories where the vm gets its packages. After that you can perform an upgrade on your vm.

```
sudo apt-get -y update
sudo apt-get -y upgrade
```

Okay okay, now it's time to install Apache2

```
sudo apt-get -y install apache2
```

Boom... Done! :D

<summary>Downloading a file from my webserver and finding the log of my download</summary>
  
### why this simple task had to be too complex?

Let's use netcat to download the file. This was way too complex to do it this way. I had to initiate two other terminal processes to transfer files using the loopback address and netcat. It's much easier to use curl for this, because we already initiated the apache2 service by installing it.

### but anyway....

I created a file called "i-very-much-exist", wrote "trolololol" in the file, created a directory "trololo" for the file, moved the file to the directory I created and then used netcat to make the file downloadable. I pushed the file with netcat, created a new terminal session, moved to my home directory, downloaded the file with netcat, created the third process and checked if the file downloaded with its content. And it worked haha. These commands can be used to repeat the process.

```
mkdir trololo
cd trololo
echo trolololo > i-very-much-exist
cat i-very-much-exist | nc -vlp 4000
nc -v 127.0.0.1 4000 > i-very-much-exist
cd
cat i-very-much-exist 
```
