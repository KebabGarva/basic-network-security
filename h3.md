## Warm-up exercise

### Disobey 2024: Zero Trust - Dope or Nope by Sami Laiho

- Session was about the Zero trust model
- Zero trust is three principles
  - Verify explicitly
  - Use least privileged access
    - most important according to Sami
    - hence the t-shirt "admin rights are not human rights"
  - Assume breach
    - This is when people want to escalate administrative rights
- I think the presentation was absolutely amazing
  - I agree that Zero Trust as a name sucks and we need to change how to communicate about the security model
  - But like... I don't understand why he doesn't use Linux if security is the top priority for him :D
    - Anyway, amazing that he made Windows actually secure and I hope that his practices are put to wide use

### Command Line Basics Revisited by Tero Karvinen

- **Use the tab key religiously (my opinion)**
  - it autocompletes or gives suggestions of all possible e.g. files that you can manipulate or move to

- `pwd` (print working directory) shows the full path of the directory, where the current user is currently located

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f3d7937-d366-43dc-9d38-0d9a25ab1bb4)

- `ls` (list) shows what files the directory contains
  - by default it doesn't show exactly everything like dotfiles.
  
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c322069f-daf7-48fd-a717-37e912732a02)

  - add the flag `-a` to show all the files

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/343920c7-4c4d-4ff9-a438-6f37c638ace7)

- `cd` (change directory) is used to navigate through the file system. (Notice how directory changed)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a872b0a2-3601-4e75-887d-09ea2d5d3192)

  
  - don't know where to navigate? use `ls` to check the files


    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b500ff61-53a3-4dd9-ad60-63cbbc17b484)

  - if you try this exercise by yourself, for the love of god... **DO NOT WRITE THE WHOLE DIRECTORY NAME BY HAND! USE TAB TO AUTOCOMPLETE! BASH IS VERY SMART!!**

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4323a25d-5577-4e6b-8ada-7f354236985d)

  - and if you want to return one directory back, type TWO dots **not one, because one dot will not do anything**

  - if you type cd without anything else, it will return back to your home directory regardless where you're located at

    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0442451-3bf8-4625-84cb-033e4e712a5d)

  - `~` means home so you can use it too if you want. Ideal use for `~` is when you want to "skip" specifying `/home/your-user-name-example/` on your `cd` command.

    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3fb1ad1-2728-4cbe-ba4b-76a53576ee0e)


- `mkdir` (make directory) will make a directory

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2544254-1feb-48a1-bd1f-1d181c0d877b)

  - you can use the `-p` flag to make parent directories as needed
    
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e824150d-6192-4669-a914-6e2ba933b8cb)

  - and don't remember to **SMASH** that TAB button! *bell sound*


okay this was supposed to be just a warm-up exercise but hey here are some tips to navigate the directory :DD

## Bandit 0-4

The most important part of this exercise was to put the [bandit radio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_podzD4cSA) on repeat from the famous video game franchise [S.T.A.L.K.E.R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.T.A.L.K.E.R.)

I actually did some of these exercises before but I don't remember anything from them :D Let's see how easily I can solve these

**А ну, чики-брики и в дамки :DDD**

Completed these exercises in under 5 minutes, but reporting took way much longer. uuughhh

<details>
<summary>0 -> 1</summary>

### Just connect to the machine using ssh and print the readme to the terminal with cat

Use these commands to solve the exercise

```
ssh bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 -l bandit0
cat readme
exit
ssh bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 -l bandit1
```

**IMPORANT: Use CTRL+SHIFT+C to copy and CTRL+SHIFT+V to paste in the bash terminal**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18292129-b80f-4c22-84b3-8d10c216e66f)

This was copy-pasteable from their website

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43b93d05-87c0-4bb8-95c8-27d97be41df5)

I just typed `cat` , smashed the tab button, typed r and smashed the tab button again

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc3387f0-af6b-4e6a-9ed7-2e4568589322)

Couldn't connect to bandit1 through bandit0 so I had to `exit`. 

</details>

<details>
<summary>1 -> 2</summary>

### Had to specify the path before the successful cat print

Use these commands to solve the exercise

```
cat ~/-
exit
ssh bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 -l bandit2
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/733c3a4c-28f7-4d6a-b05f-1cc8bfb5a14d)

Mission failed succesfully when I showed perfectly what commands do not work when trying to print the file to the terminal. I used tab to autocomplete

</details>

<details>
<summary>2 -> 3</summary>

### This is the reason why TAB is your best friend in Bash

Use these commands to solve the exercise... I MEAN JUST SPAM TAB

```
cat JUST SMASH TAB REPEATABLY PLEASE DON'T COPY THIS YOU'LL SEE!
exit
ssh bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 -l bandit3
```

[Ooooh you makin' me liiive now HONAYH](https://youtu.be/HaZpZQG2z10?si=QmVJf9WtX0gnh-3L&t=28)

</details>

<details>
<summary>3 -> 4</summary>

### I mean... I solved this again by just spamming TAB

Use these commands to solve the exercise... OR JUST SPAM TAB

```
cat inhere/...Hiding-From-You
exit
ssh bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 -l bandit4
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9a2ee36-c0d6-48f7-9a98-70ba342e81c7)

You don't need to be in the working directory to print out what is in the file. Just specify the path to the file from your working directory.
  
</details>

<details>
<summary>4 -> 5</summary>

### Again the same thing, but I just manually checked all the files because there were not that many files

Use these commands to solve the exercise... AND USE TAB!

```
cat cat inhere/-file07
exit
ssh bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 -l bandit5
```

Use the up arrow key to scroll through the previous commands used.
