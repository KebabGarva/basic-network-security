  - directs your internet traffic through random relays on the internet
  - decrypting data at each relay ("entry", "middle", and "exit)
    - makes it hard to track the original sender or recipient
- Tor was initially developed by the US government in 2002
  - It's now open-source
  - not controlled by any entity
- Couple ways to identify users in TOR
  - seeding an email or document with tracking codes
  - analyzing online behavior and digital footprints outside of tor network

## TOR TIME!

Because I installed the vm and the tor browser during the lesson, I report my installing process through memory:

- I decided to try Boxes VM manager to use virtualized version of Fedora 40 Live media.
- The live media was already installed so I just started the vm through Boxes
- After turning the vm on, I downloaded the compressed file from Tor's official website.
- Navigated to the directory where the file is located `cd Downloads`
- Extracted the file with `tar -xf tor-browser-linux-x86_64-13.5.6.tar.xz`
- Navigated to the file using `cd tor-browser`
- Launched the tor browser using `./start-tor-browser.desktop`

Anyway, let's go down to business.

These were my favourite discoveries while browsing the TOR network.
