### Quintin 2014: 7 Things You Should Know About Tor

- Tor is to this day...
  - working anonymoys browser
  - 100% legal in USA
  - easy to use
- Tor is not just criminals and pedophiles

### Shavers & Bair 2016: Hiding Behind the Keyboard: The Tor Browser â‚¬

- Tor hides your true IP address
  - directs your internet traffic through random relays on the internet
  - decrypting data at each relay ("entry", "middle", and "exit)
    - makes it hard to track the original sender or recipient
- Tor was initially developed by the US government in 2002
  - It's now open-source
  - not controlled by any entity
- Couple ways to identify users in TOR
  - seeding an email or document with tracking codes
  - analyzing online behavior and digital footprints outside of tor network
  - exploiting user errors and weaknesses in browser settings


## TOR TIME!

Because I installed the vm and the tor browser during the lesson, I report my installing process through memory:

- I decided to try Boxes VM manager to use virtualized version of Fedora 40 Live media.
- The live media was already installed so I just started the vm through Boxes
- After turning the vm on, I downloaded the compressed file from Tor's official website.
- Navigated to the directory where the file is located `cd Downloads`
- Extracted the file with `tar -xf tor-browser-linux-x86_64-13.5.6.tar.xz`
- Navigated to the file using `cd tor-browser`
- Launched the tor browser using `./start-tor-browser.desktop`

Anyway, let's go down to business. BUT FIRST...

Okay now we can go.

I use this to check the most popular sites in the dark web. Thanks to this, I can actually find some onion sites that actually work.

This is one example of a well known organization/news agency that has a public physical street address.
