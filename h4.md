## Warm-up exercise

### OWASP 10 2021

<details>
<summary>A01:2021</summary>

### Broken access control

- Access control enforces policy such that users cannot act outside of their intended permissions.
  - In other hand broken access control will enable unauthorized users to do unauthorized tasks in the company infrastructure
- Common access control vulnerabilities include:
  - Violations of the Zero trust principle
  - Elevation of privilege
  - Bypassing security control by modifying the url

<details>
<summary>A03:2021</summary>

### Injection

- The attacker can inject malicious data or commands into an database application like SQL
- The vulnerability can be already detected from the URL address
  - Most common injections are through the URL address and login pages
- Injections can destroy entire databases if you don't use e.g
  - A safe API
  - Positive server-side input validation

### Security Misconfiguration

- Examples of security misconfigurations:
  - Default usernames and passwords
  - Unnecessary features and applications are still used
  - Out of date software
- How to prevent
  - Constant hardening of the software
  - Miminal software as possible
  - Security groups

### Vulnerable and Outdated Components

#### How to combat

- Software updates
	- Be aware what components and software versions you are using
	- Make sure to have the latest stable version of the software

- Use the right software to your requirements
	- check if there are better and MORE SECURE solutions
		- usually open source is the best option
	 
- scan for vulnerabilities regularly
	- take necessary steps to fix it

#### Example scenarios by Saku Laitinen

Bad scenario:

- You use Windows 2000 server or very old Linux server distro from the year 2000
- Your router is so old/outdated that it doesn't have a firewall

Not bad but not good scenario:

- You use Windows 10 server or Linux server distro that doesn't receive security updates any more 
- You don't have the latest updates
- You don't use SecureBoot

Not good but still kinda ok scenario:

- You use Windows 10 server
- You HAVE the latest updates
- You use SecureBoot

Good scenario:

- You use Linux server like Ubuntu, Debian or Fedora server
- You use SecureBoot or you just use software that don't need to use the kernel

## WebGoat: Developer Tools

### First exercise

By default the developer tools open by pressing F12. For this exercise I simply navigated to the console tab, pasted `webgoat.customjs.phoneHome()` in the console, and I got the random number that is located after 
`"phoneHome Response is EXAMPLE NUMBER"`

### Second exercise

I clicked on "GO" to send the HTTP request. I navigated to the network tab. It didn't take long to find the file "network".

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/046fd080-1ab3-4211-ae47-26181bac98f3)

At first I was in the headers tab. Then I selected the latest network-file and went to the request tab and there the number was!

In the end, I just did what the instructions instructed me to do!

The first two exercises were pretty simple too, and I did what the instructions instructed me to do.

The exercises below I did just for fun :D

[This article](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_in.asp) helped me to remind me of the IN operator

This was confusing but again W3schools saved me

## Updating my Fedora Workstation 40 Linux

The first time I used the `dnf` package mananager, I refered to [this instruction](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/dnf-vs-apt/) before doing anything because I mainly used debian based distributions.

I upgrade my Linux using the following command:

```
sudo dnf upgrade --refresh
```

<details>

<summary>Made this dropdown to save some space</summary>

### Console printouts

Even though dnf updates its package cache automatically, I want to be 100% sure that I'm getting the most recent updates. Maybe I just should just switch to Debian based distros if I want to manually update the repositories :D

Here are some screenshots of the upgrade process:

## PortSwigger SQL injection

**TLDR; Break out of the SQL query with an apostrophe `'` and comment the rest of the query out with `--`**

I remember doing this exercise before and I remember exactly what I did then to solve the exercise. At first, I just clicked the links in the exercise and noticed that the address changed a bit, if I refined my search by category. Because I know how SQL works and I read the exercise description, I knew that I had to change the URL a bit. The biggest clue was the lab description where `category` was an actual SQL table entry. Haha and it's very clearly in the URL address.

![Screenshot from 2024-09-14 19-21-01](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ed4f960-b8ee-4486-8fd4-3c6c1c890cc6)

![Screenshot from 2024-09-14 19-18-21](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/421eda5a-cf89-4d52-9cf2-0d7ef478b155)

Then I just gave a random category like "haha" and gave OR condition 1=1 to give me all the products. The reason why there's a apostrophe after the category is because I have to break out of the category name. SQL injection will not work then because it will search for a category like "haha OR 1=1". Because 1=1 is always TRUE, the website gave me access to all prdoucts! It will ignore the previous statement, because it's FALSE. I commented the rest of the SQL statements with `--`, because the products that I'm trying to look for are not released yet.

![Screenshot from 2024-09-14 19-51-52](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3fff4358-fe52-42f8-8e5a-29e8af517cf7)


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7de3e48-439c-4d22-9e8d-8ce9df205297)

To clarify what exactly happened, I show the actual SQL query for you. The "gifts" can be replaced with anything and it's there just to make the comparison easier.  

```
ORIGINAL
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1

MODIFIED
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' OR 1=1 --' AND released = 1
```
