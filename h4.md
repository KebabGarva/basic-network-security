### Broken access control

- Access control enforces policy such that users cannot act outside of their intended permissions.
  - In other hand broken access control will enable unauthorized users to do unauthorized tasks in the company infrastructure
- Common access control vulnerabilities include:
  - Violations of the Zero trust principle
  - Elevation of privilege
  - Bypassing security control by modifying the url

### Injection

- The attacker can inject malicious data or commands into an database application like SQL
- The vulnerability can be already detected from the URL address
  - Most common injections are through the URL address and login pages
- Injections can destroy entire databases if you don't use e.g
  - A safe API
  - Positive server-side input validation

### Security Misconfiguration

- Examples of security misconfigurations:
  - Default usernames and passwords
  - Unnecessary features and applications are still used
  - Out of date software
- How to prevent
  - Constant hardening of the software
  - Miminal software as possible
  - Security groups

### Vulnerable and Outdated Components

#### How to combat

- Software updates
	- Be aware what components and software versions you are using
	- Make sure to have the latest stable version of the software

- Use the right software to your requirements
	- check if there are better and MORE SECURE solutions
		- usually open source is the best option
	 
- scan for vulnerabilities regularly
	- take necessary steps to fix it

#### Example scenarios by Saku Laitinen

Bad scenario:

- You use Windows 2000 server or very old Linux server distro from the year 2000
- Your router is so old/outdated that it doesn't have a firewall

Not bad but not good scenario:

- You use Windows 10 server or Linux server distro that doesn't receive security updates any more 
- You don't have the latest updates
- You don't use SecureBoot

Not good but still kinda ok scenario:

- You use Windows 10 server
- You HAVE the latest updates
- You use SecureBoot

Good scenario:

- You use Linux server like Ubuntu, Debian or Fedora server
- You use SecureBoot or you just use software that don't need to use the kernel
