### When?

The whole report was done on 22nd August 2024.


## Warm-up exercise

The point of the exercise is to summarize the topic given in the exercise.

### Threat modeling

- In a nutshell, threat modeling analyzes all the ways an attacker can exploit the system
- Threat modeling process should answer the following four questions:
  - What are we working on?
  - What can go wrong?
  - How are we going to achieve it?
  - How well did we do our job?
- Based on the questions above, threat modeling is divided into four parts:
  - System modeling
  - Threat identification
  - Response and Mitigations
  - Review and Validation

### Darknet Diaries - Episode 148: Dubsnatch

- The episode was released on [darknetdiaries.com](https://darknetdiaries.com) on 6th August 2024.
- A story of a teenager getting a sneak peek of their favourite artist's unreleased tracks
  - The teenager exploited Bitly's flaw where you can see all the links that the user has shortened via Bitly
    - The content behind the links were e.g unreleased music, promotional material and other internal things
    - Everything could be downloaded
    - Terabytes of data were downloaded

## Security hygiene

Below is a bullet list of basic security practices everyone (especially you, hackers) should follow. Following these practices will save a lot of stress and time.

### The mandatory cyber security practices that all individuals (especially you, hackers) should follow

- Update your system regularly

  - The older the software, the easier is to hack into them

    - Hackers had the time to study security vulnerabilities of older systems and that's why
    
      - it's less likely that you're on the hackers' radar if you're using the newest edition of your computer software with the newest updates
      - hackers divert their attention to other less secure targets using older software ignoring the unnecessarily harder targets with the newest software to achieve their goals much easily

- Use antivirus or switch to **Linux**

  - Switching to Linux is preferable because it's

    - free
  
    - **more secure and private**
      - malware development is designated strongly towards Windows users
      - more security layers in granting permissions
      - open source grants everyone with knowledge to fix security bugs
        - [Linux backdoor exploit](https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/2/24119342/xz-utils-linux-backdoor-attempt) was found and patched thanks to open source
      - no big-tech companies spying on you by default
    
    - customizable to your specific needs

- Use a password manager

  - I personally recommend **[BitWarden](https://bitwarden.com/)**

    - It's easy to use, free and open-source
  
  - Eliminates the need to remember multiple passwords and fear of multiple compromised accounts using **the same leaked password**
    
    - You just need to remember and train typing the one password that is very different from the ones you used before  
    - **Choose the most secure master password you can learn to remember and** ***don't use it anywhere else***
  
- Verify the sender's identity before engaging with the sent content

  - By default, absolutely no-one is to be trusted on the web
  - You never randomly won a new phone from a lottery you didn't know about before the email
  - If you opened the link sent by someone you had a conversation with, don't share anything confidential or log in to a known service like Facebook

- Use MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)

  - If someone tries to log in (including you) to your account, the service requires additional authentication like using the one-time code that was either sent to your email/phone number or the number generated using the TOTP (time-based one-time password) algorithm in an authenticator app like [Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en&pli=1)

- Don't tinker with firewall settings before you know ***exactly*** what you're doing
  
  - You can accidentally open ports that hackers can exploit to deliver their payloads

- Use a content blocker like [uBlock](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin)
  - It's not just an ad-blocker because it can block e.g malware sites and pop-up windows.
 

## Make-belief cyber bogeyman

This exercise was inspired by [this Youtube video by Boot-Cat studio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLJkg_B3gyY) where they bought their own game and found out who were reselling the games. The video is supposed to be a warning to other indie developers and publishers to be careful with giving out product codes. 

Often, the developers or publishers give out product keys for their games, so that well-known content creators and game reviewers can give exposure to the game. This kind of exposure is very important for indie developers and publishers, because they usually don't have the money to go for customary, physical marketing. That's why they rely so much on content creators and game reviewers to gain much exposure as possible for their product.

The bogeyman in question is a person or a group that has a reputation of being a well-known game reviewer and product key seller. They get their product keys straight from the developers and sell the product keys on e.g G2A for a much lower price compared to an official platform like Steam. By doing that, they direct the flow of money to their bank accounts by frauding indie developers and publishers. It's deemed as illegal and immoral practice where the victims are being robbed out from their money.

### What are we trying to achieve

- Product key protocol for
  - content creators and reviewers
  - giveaways
- Securing financial stability when product keys are without consent
  - sold
  - used
  - shared

### What can go wrong

- Someone on our team doesn't follow our protocol
  - They send a key to an untrusted recipient without permission
- Our website could be hacked
  - Generating and using product keys without our consent and documentation
- We go bankrupt because of lack of sales
  - no money from the game because we gave out product keys too loosely
- People exchanging product keys without others' information

### The solution

- A zero-trust model
  - specific terms and conditions using the product key/keys
  - automatic cancellation of product keys meant only for reviews after a certain period of time
  - don't use Steam's [Curator Connect](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/curators)
    - only when you know the product key recipient in real life
  - Product key giveaways only through us not by reviewers
  - Up-to-date documentation/log of review and giveaway product keys and the recipients of the keys in question
    - the documentation is kept safe and can't be modified
    - If the keys are somehow deleted from the system, the key deactivates immidiately
- Heavy fines put to place for breaking the protocol 
  - Employee
  - Anyone outside of the company
  - Warn the community about the fraudsters in question
    - minimize future financial damage to our company
    - fraudsters get reputational damage
 
### Maintaining and improving the solution

- Hiring pentesters to test how well employees obey the protocol
- Improving and adjusting the threat model
- Sharing our ideas with other indie developers
  - Developing a possible standard for sharing product keys that can be an alternative solution to Curator Connect
