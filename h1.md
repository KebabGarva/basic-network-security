### Threat modeling

- In a nutshell, threat modeling analyzes all the ways an attacker can exploit the system
- Threat modeling process should answer the following four questions:
  - What are we working on?
  - What can go wrong?
  - How are we going to achieve it?
  - How well did we do our job?
- Based on the questions above, threat modeling is divided into four parts:
  - System modeling
  - Threat identification
  - Response and Mitigations
  - Review and Validation

## a) Security hygiene

Below is a bullet list of basic security practices everyone should follow

### The bare minimum practices for safe computer use

- **Update your system regularly**
- Use antivirus or switch to **Linux**
  - Switching to Linux is preferable because it's
    - free
    - **more secure and private**
    - open source
    - customizable to your specific needs
- Use a password manager
  - I personally recommend [BitWarden](https://bitwarden.com/)
    - It's easy to use, free and open-source
  - Eliminates the need to remember multiple passwords and fear of multiple compromised accounts using the same leaked password
    - You just need to remember and train typing the one password that is very different from the ones you used before
      - More complicated password, the better
- Verify the sender's identity before engaging with the sent content
  - By default, no one is to be trusted on the web
  - You never randomly won a new phone from a lottery you didn't know about before the email
  - If you opened the link, don't share anything confidential or log in to a known service like Facebook
- Use MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)
- Don't tinker with firewall settings before you know ***exactly*** what you're doing
