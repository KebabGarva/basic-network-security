## Introduction

### What?

This report is made for exercise **h6** to Tero Karvinen's course [Information security](https://terokarvinen.com/information-security/). Clicking on the links in the table of contents help you navigate through the report.

### Where?

This exercise is done using the following equipment:

- [*Physical hardware: Lenovo Legion 7 16ACHg6*](https://nanoreview.net/en/laptop/lenovo-legion-7-2021-amd?m=c.1_g.3_r.3_s.3)
- [*Operating system: Fedora Workstation 40*](https://fedoraproject.org/workstation/download)

### When?

The report was done on 26 September 2024 for the mandatory exercises.

## Warm-up exercise

### Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: 2.3 One-Way Functions and 2.4 One-Way Hash Functions

- One-way functions are functions where it's easy to compute a value from an input but it's very hard to reverse-engineer the original input.
  - Easy to break, hard to reassemble
  - Trapdoor one-way functions are type of one-way functions that are easy to reverse if you know a secret key (e.g password).
- Hash functions put the one-way functions to practice
  - Fixed lenght for output string
- Hash functions are used in...
  - Fingerprinting files
  - Financial transactions
  - Verification

## Hashcat time!

Installing hashcat and checking the install:

```
sudo dnf install hashcat
hashcat -V
```

The `-V` flag stands for version. It's one of the most common ways to check if install succeeded.

Because I want to keep the exercise related-stuff in a seperate folder, I created a directory `information-security-exercises/h6` to make it easier for me. I typed `cd` first to navigate to my home directory. The `-p` flag stands for making parent directories if needed.

**NOTE: SOME OF THESE COMMANDS I FOUND THROUGH THE `history` COMMAND BECAUSE BRUTE-FORCING CREATED TO MUCH TEXT THAT I COULDN'T RETURN TO TAKE SCREEHOTS**

```
cd
mkdir -p information-security-exercises/h6
cd information-security-exercises/h6/
```

From this point forward, I used Tero Karvinen's [hashcat tutorial](https://terokarvinen.com/2022/cracking-passwords-with-hashcat/) as my cheat sheet. Then I proceeded to download and compress the rockyou dictionary. I also deleted the duplicate file.

```
wget https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/raw/master/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt.tar.gz
tar xf rockyou.txt.tar.gz
rm rockyou.txt.tar.gz
```

Then I tested to crack the hash for 'September2024!' using the dictionary attack. I used the sha-256 hashing algorithm. I did not succeed.

First I created the hash and identified its hashid. The `-n` flag prevents the command printing it to the terminal. The `|` operator takes the first command's output and makes it the input for the succeeding command. The `-m` flag outputs the hashid results to terminal.

```
echo -n 'September2024!' | sha256sum
hashid -m f4877088d168237e10649675f5e4bbfe2edd69496475960db381fe79b3796cc5
```

Cracking time. The output can be assigned to anything like `solvedkaboom.txt` or even `i-love-your-friends.pdf`. The `-m` flag selects the type of hashing algorithm to be cracked. Sha256 is number 1400. Then I have to specify the wordlist to be used which is `rockyou.txt`. Finally I assigned the output with `-o` flag.

```
hashcat -m 1400 'f4877088d168237e10649675f5e4bbfe2edd69496475960db381fe79b3796cc5' rockyou.txt -o solvedkaboom.txt
```

The dictionary is exhausted and I wanted to test to use brute-force to solve it. To use brute-force I had to specify it with the `-a` flag. By default it uses the dictionary attack which is `-a 0`. When something is default, I don't need to specify it in the command line.

```
hashcat -a 3 -w 3 -m 1400 f4877088d168237e10649675f5e4bbfe2edd69496475960db381fe79b3796cc5&apos rockyou.txt -o solvedkaboom.txt
```

This is one command btw don't let the second row fool you. ☝️☝️

I decided it takes too long without tinkering so I leave the password to be unsolved for now. Only thing I tinkered was the workload with the `-w` flag. Number 3 is the high performance mode.

I proceeded to crack the hash 'd595b2086532422bbe654bc07ea030df'. First hashid, and then hashcat.

```
hashid -m d595b2086532422bbe654bc07ea030df
hashcat -m 0 d595b2086532422bbe654bc07ea030df rockyou.txt -o finally.txt
```

Then I checked the password. Oh yeah... Thanks for reminding me that I can't afford to go to Disobey 2025 :DD

```
cat finally.txt
```
