## Warm-up exercise

### Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: 2.3 One-Way Functions and 2.4 One-Way Hash Functions

- One-way functions are functions where it's easy to compute a value from an input but it's very hard to reverse-engineer the original input.
  - Easy to break, hard to reassemble
  - Trapdoor one-way functions are type of one-way functions that are easy to reverse if you know a secret key (e.g password).
- Hash functions put the one-way functions to practice
  - Fixed lenght for output string
- Hash functions are used in...
  - Fingerprinting files
  - Financial transactions
  - Verification
