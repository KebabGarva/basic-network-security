## Introduction

### What?

This report is made for exercise **h5** to Tero Karvinen's course [Information security](https://terokarvinen.com/information-security/). Clicking on the links in the table of contents help you navigate through the report.

### Where?

This exercise is done using the following equipment:

- [*Physical hardware: Lenovo Legion 7 16ACHg6*](https://nanoreview.net/en/laptop/lenovo-legion-7-2021-amd?m=c.1_g.3_r.3_s.3)
- [*Operating system: Fedora Workstation 40*](https://fedoraproject.org/workstation/download)

### When?

The report was done on 18 September 2024 for the mandatory exercises.

## Warm-up exercise

### Foundations of Cryptography

- The chapter Foundations is from Bruce Schneier's book "Applied Cryptography: Protocols, Algorithms and Source Code in C"
- Cryptographic algorithm (a.k.a Cipher) is the mathematical function to encrypt and decrypt messages
  - Symmetrical algorithms work with a one key that encrypts and decrypts the algorithm
  - Asymmetrical algorithms work with a public and a private key
    - Public key is the encryption that is available for everyone
    - Private key is the decryption that is available only to the recipient
- I understood the concept of assymetrical algorithms when someone explained it in the point of view of a post box
  - Public key is the post box in a street for everyone to put mail in
  - Private key is the actual key to open the post box.

### Pretty Good Privacy using GNU Privacy Guard

- The referred article "PGP - Send Encrypted and Signed Message - gpg" by Tero Karvinen is about basic use of gpg.
- The process can be divided into five parts:
  - Generating the private and the public key
  - Exporting the public key for others to use for communicating secretly with the recipient
  - Verifying the public keys by signing them
  - Sender encrypts the message with recipients public key
  - Recipient decrypts the key with their private key

## Testing pgp for encrypting and decrypting messages

For this exercise, I used Tero's pgp tutorial because it made it pretty easy to test gpg locally.

I generated the key and GNOME's alert made me laugh a bit. I got confused because I thought I just need to confirm via the terminal not through GNOME.

Anyway, I did exactly what Tero's article instructed me to do. I just replaced the names to my liking. Tero is now Sakke and Alice is Nakke.

Exporting Sakke's public key

Making Nakke's directory, "sending" Sakke's public key to Nakke's directory and importing the key

This is the reason why you want a secure communication. Imagine if a hacker catches the message somehow and suddenly everyone can know what you wrote in the sensitivite message e.g. confessing that you ate all of the product samples :DD

## KeePassXC might be better than Bitwarden?
